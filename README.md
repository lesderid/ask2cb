# ASK2CB (and ASK2CA) FPGA dev board resources

![ASK2CB](https://pomf.soupwhale.com/cjtxuy.jpg)

Example code and documentation for the DIGIASIC/BAIXUN ASK2CB Cyclone II
FPGA development board (and the similar ASK2CA).

If you want a cheap Chinese FPGA dev board, this might have been a good
choice in 2011. There are probably better options out there now, but if
you're stuck with this one it can be hard to find good documentation for
it.

This repo contains everything I've found on this board through
Google/Baidu, board markings, and [a nice
person](https://hackaday.io/UncleYong) on Hackaday.io.

Pull requests with additional information very welcome. In particular
I'm still looking for the sources for the design stored on the EPCS4
when I got the board.

## Board specs (rev V1.0)

*These specs may differ slightly from revision to revision.*

**Note: Many pins are shared between peripherals, consult the documentation.**
